## Data & Code

### Data
Dataset is fetched from SMKs digital collection using the [SMK-API](https://www.smk.dk/en/article/smk-api/). The dataset used for this analysis can be found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chcaa/smk_canon_paintings).

It should be noted that SMK frequently updates their collection, meaning that there could appear changes in the SMK-API that are not in our dataset, for example to the SMK-IDs or the image URLs. Therefore, pay attention if any images fail when downloading the image files from the URLs.

### Code

- ```src/analyses_utils.py``` and ```src/run_analyses.py``` contain the code to run the full analysis on the canon-paintings data. The scripts can be run with set arguments with ```run_analyses.sh``` and output is in the ```results/``` folder
- ```nbs/canon_analysis.ipynb``` runs the same functions as ```src/run_analyses.py``` but in a notebook style with added, descriptive markdown chunks and the option to run each step of the analysis seperately.
- ```src/greyscale_embeddings.py``` and ```src/smk_embeddings.py``` contains the code to extract colored and greyscaled embeddings for the dataset of paintings. These are already in the dataset uploaded to [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/louisebrix/smk_canon_paintings).

#### Running the code
All code was run using macOS 15.6.1 in Visual Studio Code with Python 3.13.3.

Set up the virtual environment and install required packages with 
```
bash setup.sh
```

Next, run analysis with default arguments with
```
bash run_analyses.sh 
```
Results are in the ```/results``` folder.
